1,Physics-Informed Neural Operators for the Poisson Equation,"This project demonstrates a Physics-Informed Neural Operator (PINO) approach to the Poisson equation, combining operator learning with explicit enforcement of governing physics. The model learns a global solution operator while preserving physical consistency, bridging the gap between classical PINNs and purely data-driven neural operators.",YouTube,5-Jan-2026,6,Planned,14-Feb-2026,,
2,Fast PDE Solution Learning with Fourier Neural Operators,"This project showcases the Fourier Neural Operator for learning solution operators of partial differential equations directly in function space. By operating in the spectral domain, the model captures global dependencies efficiently, enabling rapid and scalable prediction of PDE solutions without explicitly enforcing equation residuals during training.",YouTube,5-Jan-2026,6,Open For Requests,,,
3,Autonomous PINN Single Agent Solver with LLM-Driven Orchestration and Self-Verification,"This project demonstrates an autonomous Physics-Informed Neural Network workflow where an LLM generates, trains, evaluates, and iteratively improves a PINN solver end-to-end. The system enforces PDE physics, validates numerical accuracy through tests, and self-corrects until convergence—showcasing agentic AI applied to scientific computing, not just code generation.",YouTube,5-Jan-2026,7,Open For Requests,,,
4,Multi-Agent Autonomous PINN Solver with Role-Specialized LLM Agents,"Build a multi-agent PINN system where distinct LLM agents handle problem specification, solver generation, testing, evaluation, and corrective updates. The workflow forms a closed self-verification loop that enforces physics constraints and numerical accuracy until convergence.",YouTube,27-Jan-2026,3,Open For Requests,,,
5,Autonomous Code Generation with LLM Agents Using Terminal Bench,"This tutorial demonstrates an autonomous code-generation system evaluated using Terminal Bench, where an LLM-driven agent operates directly through a terminal interface to solve real programming tasks end-to-end. The agent plans actions, writes code, executes commands, interprets runtime errors, and iteratively repairs its solution based on terminal feedback—without human intervention. The tutorial focuses on autonomy, tool use, and verification loops, highlighting how agentic systems move beyond static code generation toward executable, self-correcting software workflows.",YouTube,27-Jan-2026,3,Open For Requests,,,
6,AI-Assisted PINNs Development Workflow using GitHub Copilot (VS Code),"This video demonstrates how GitHub Copilot is used inside VS Code as a development assistant while building a PINN-based PDE solver, focusing on real scientific-computing workflows rather than teaching PINNs from scratch. It shows project structure, code scaffolding, PDE residual and boundary condition implementation, and training loop setup, while clearly highlighting where Copilot speeds up boilerplate and pattern repetition and where human physics judgment and domain understanding remain essential.",YouTube,27-Jan-2026,6,Open For Requests,,,
