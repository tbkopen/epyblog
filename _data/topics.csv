1,Inverse Modeling of 2D Incompressible Navier–Stokes Equations Under Transient Conditions Using Physics Informed Neural Networks (PINNs),"This project demonstrates an inverse Physics-Informed Neural Network (PINN) approach for the Navier–Stokes equations, where unknown physical parameters are identified directly from observed flow data. By embedding the governing equations into training, the model recovers both the flow fields and hidden physics in a data-efficient, physically consistent manner.",Course Only,5-Jan-2026,8,Published,16-Jan-2026,https://exly.co/PvxFUL,
2,Physics-Informed Neural Networks for Long-Time Integration of Dynamical Systems: A Case Study on the 1D Damped Harmonic Oscillator,"We investigate a solver-centric physics-informed neural network formulation for the 1D damped harmonic oscillator.The neural network is embedded within an explicit time-marching scheme and is responsible only for predicting the system acceleration, while kinematic relations and time integration are enforced explicitly. Training is performed by minimizing the governing-equation residual during sequential time stepping. This setup enables a focused study of long-time integration behavior, including error growth and stability, without relying on global solution representations.",YouTube,5-Jan-2026,9,Planned,25-Jan-2026,,
3,Physics-Informed Neural Operators for the Poisson Equation,"This project demonstrates a Physics-Informed Neural Operator (PINO) approach to the Poisson equation, combining operator learning with explicit enforcement of governing physics. The model learns a global solution operator while preserving physical consistency, bridging the gap between classical PINNs and purely data-driven neural operators.",YouTube,5-Jan-2026,6,Open For Requests,,,
4,Fast PDE Solution Learning with Fourier Neural Operators,"This project showcases the Fourier Neural Operator for learning solution operators of partial differential equations directly in function space. By operating in the spectral domain, the model captures global dependencies efficiently, enabling rapid and scalable prediction of PDE solutions without explicitly enforcing equation residuals during training.",YouTube,5-Jan-2026,6,Open For Requests,,,
5,Autonomous PINN Single Agent Solver with LLM-Driven Orchestration and Self-Verification,"This project demonstrates an autonomous Physics-Informed Neural Network workflow where an LLM generates, trains, evaluates, and iteratively improves a PINN solver end-to-end. The system enforces PDE physics, validates numerical accuracy through tests, and self-corrects until convergence—showcasing agentic AI applied to scientific computing, not just code generation.",YouTube,5-Jan-2026,7,Open For Requests,,,
