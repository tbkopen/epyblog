Over the past year, the **PINNs Masterclass** has grown significantly — both in depth and in breadth. What began as a focused course gradually expanded to include fundamentals, inverse problems, practical DeepXDE workflows, and several advanced techniques. <!--more-->

While this allowed us to explore many important ideas in one place, it also created a genuine problem for learners:

> **The entry point became heavier than necessary for many people.**

Different learners come to PINNs with different goals.
Some want a solid conceptual foundation.
Some want hands-on workflows.
Some want advanced techniques for specific scenarios.

Bundling all of this into a single mandatory starting point meant that learners were often forced to commit to *much more* than they actually needed.

This post explains the decisions we’ve taken to fix that — and how they affect both **new learners** and **existing students**.

## Why the course structure is changing

The goal of this restructuring is **clarity and fairness**, not content reduction.

Instead of continuing to grow one large, all-encompassing course, the content is being reorganized into **clearly scoped, standalone courses**, each focused on a single **focus area** of PINNs practice. This allows learners to:

* Start exactly where their problem lies
* Avoid over-committing upfront
* Build understanding step by step, if and when needed

Importantly, **no content is being removed**.

## How we are splitting the course

In theory, PINNs is often presented as a single framework. In practice, however, learners approach PINNs from **different modeling perspectives**, such as:

* understanding **forward and inverse problem formulations**,
* implementing PINNs through a **specific framework and workflow**,
* making **practical modeling decisions across different scenarios**.

Over time, the Masterclass accumulated content across all these perspectives. While this made it comprehensive, it also meant that:

* learners with a specific goal had to navigate a much broader course,
* scope boundaries became less obvious,
* adding new material risked blurring expectations further.

Splitting the course allows each major focus area to be **clearly scoped, independently maintained, and easier to approach**, without reducing depth.

## The new structure

The PINNs Masterclass content is now organized into **three individual DeepDive courses**, each targeting a specific focus area:

1. **PINNs: Fundamentals of Forward and Inverse Problems**
2. **PINNs: Practical Workflows with DeepXDE**
3. **Advanced PINNs: Practical Modeling Strategies**

Each of these courses stands on its own, with a clearly defined scope and learning objective.

## What happens to the existing PINNs Masterclass

The **PINNs Masterclass will continue to be available as it is**, but its role changes slightly:

* It moves from being an *individual course* to a **Curated Collection**.
* The Masterclass now groups the three focus-area courses under a single umbrella.
* This provides a consolidated view for learners who prefer to access all three areas together.

Importantly, **no content is removed** — the material is simply organized more transparently.

## What this means for existing students

If you are an existing PINNs Masterclass student:

* You **retain lifetime access** to all content you already have.
* You will continue to have access to the material that now forms the three individual courses.
* You are **not required to repurchase anything**.
* The restructuring does not change your access rights in any way.

This update is about **organization and clarity**, not about limiting access.

## What this means for future content

Going forward, the PINNs Masterclass will be treated as a **curated collection of three independent courses, each focused on a specific focus area**:

* PINNs for Forward & Inverse Problems
* PINNs with DeepXDE: Practical Workflows
* Advanced PINNs: Practical Modeling Strategies

**Any new content added within the scope of these three focus areas** will automatically be available to existing PINNs Masterclass students, in line with the lifetime access promise.

Topics that represent **clearly new focus areas** — beyond the scope of these three courses — will be developed as **independent DeepDive courses**, separate from the PINNs Masterclass scope.

This structure allows us to:

* expand existing focus areas without ambiguity,
* keep course scopes clear and well-defined,
* and develop new topics independently when they deserve standalone treatment.


## Closing note

This restructuring is not a change in direction.
It is a refinement in how the subject is represented.

By aligning the course structure with how PINNs is actually learned and used, we believe this approach benefits both:

* learners who want **focused depth**, and
* learners who prefer a **consolidated overview**.

As always, clarity and long-term sustainability guide these decisions.
